	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of its input. Efficient algorithms are those that can solve a problem quickly, even as the input size grows. The time complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using Big O notation, which helps in analyzing and comparing the performance of different algorithms.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> describes the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. It is crucial to understand space complexity because it affects the overall efficiency of an algorithm, especially when working with large datasets. For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the amount of memory it uses grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
